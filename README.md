# Webmaker
My first big practice website on HTML/CSS. And a little bit JS  
Created in April 2019
# About
This project was my first big project with layout and extensive use of styles.  
Appearance created myself, but took ideas from thematic sites. I used Flex and Grid technologies to understand for myself what is better.   
The process of creation fascinated me so much that I did it for 7 hours a day, almost without breaks.  
# Technologies used
